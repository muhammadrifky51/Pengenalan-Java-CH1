# 🚀 Java OOP-First Journey — FastCampus Course

Welcome to my experimental Java playground, where I take a **non-traditional route** by skipping the basics and diving straight into **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** with the FastCampus Java course.

## 🎯 Purpose of This Repo

This isn’t your usual “Hello, World!” starter kit.  
Instead, it’s a personal log of learning core OOP principles in Java — from encapsulation to abstraction.

> _“Note: This repo skips foundational syntax and dives straight into Java’s object-oriented design.”_

## 🧠 What I’ve Learned So Far

### ✅ Chapter 2: Object-Oriented Programming Concepts
- 🔒 **Encapsulation**: using private fields and public getters/setters to protect object integrity  
- 🧬 **Inheritance**: creating hierarchies using `extends` and code reuse  
- 🔄 **Polymorphism**: method overriding, dynamic dispatch, and treating objects generically  
- 📦 Coming soon:  
  - **Abstraction** via abstract classes  
  - **Interfaces** to define flexible behavior contracts

## 💡 Learning Approach

This repo contains:
- 🧪 Code snippets and class examples from lessons  
- 🧵 Side experiments beyond the curriculum  
- 🤔 Comments and notes directly embedded in the code  
- ⚠️ My mistakes and what I learned from them

---

## 🚧 Repo Status

🔹 Currently in early learning phase  
🔹 Focus is on understanding OOP logic and principles  
🔹 Will expand with real-world modeling and mini-projects

---

## 🌱 What's Next?

- Build mini applications that apply OOP principles  
- Learn how to refactor procedural code into clean, modular designs  
- Explore interfaces for flexible software architecture  
- Possibly add GUI (JavaFX or Swing) if I get adventurous!
